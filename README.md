# woodsmoke-data-processing
This project includes the python scripts and excel files used in analyzing woodsmoke pollution data for Cornell's Energy and the Environment Lab.

Woodsmoke air pollution poses a significant health risk in the US and around the world. Millions of people develop physical ailments due to frequent interaction with woodsmoke. It is a leading cause of lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure and quantify the amount of pollution or "dirtiness" of woodsmoke in the air. Often it requires expensive instrumentation and infrastructure. 

In this project, we seeked to use an Aethalometer - a inexpensive optical instrument - to measure woodsmoke pollution around Ithaca. We then analyzed the data to search for correlation among woodsmoke characteristics, such as it Angstrom absoprtion exponent, or black/brown carbon ratio. Our project showed that it is possible to combine relatively cheap instrumentation with algorithmic data analysis to classify the dirtiness of woodsmoke air pollution.

The main file is ExcelData.py. From there, you define which data file you want to analyze and which file you want to write the results to. For this project, the data was stored in an excel file.
